# 2.5d-ray-casting-room-in-golang

Project demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INYyC1Igl9o&ab_channel=UndeadSasuke

Had a couple of free evenings at my disposal. Decided to do something I've always wanted: a 2.5D game! Well, that's a lot to say about this project. It's more like a 2.5 room where you can move around, and that's about it üòÅ. Also, decided to do it in a language I've never written a line of code before: Golang. I'd say I did ok.

Features: 
- 2.5d ray casting with DDA algorithm and SDL
- wall texture mapping
- player keyboard and mouse movement

Might want to add more to this as my time allows.
